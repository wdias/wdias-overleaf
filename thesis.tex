\chapter*{Abstract}

\acrfull{nwm} utilize data collected via diverse sources such as automated weather stations, radars, air balloons, and satellite images. Before using such multimodal data into a NWM, it is necessary to transcode data into a format that can be ingested by the NWM. Moreover, the data integration system's response time needs to be relatively low to forecast and monitor time-sensitive weather events like hurricanes, storms, and flash floods that require rapid and frequent execution of \acrshort{nwm}. The resulting weather data also need to be accessed by many researchers and third-party applications such as logistic companies and agricultural insurance.
Even though there are several weather data integration systems, they are based on monolithic or client-server architectures and are unable to benefit from novel computational models such as cloud computing and containers. Moreover, most of this software is proprietary or closed sourced; hence, it is difficult to customize such software for an island like Sri Lanka with different weather seasons.
Therefore, in this research, we propose \acrfull{wdias} that utilizes modern architecture pattern such as microservices to achieve scalability, high availability, and low-cost operation based on cloud computing. \acrshort{wdias} provides a modular architecture to integrate data from different sources, export into different formats, and the inbuilt extension module system allow users to add new features. Due to the use of stateless microservices, \acrshort{wdias} achieves high scalability, availability, and enables the addition of new features on the fly with rollover capabilities. We demonstrate the utility of \acrshort{wdias} using cloud-based experimental setup and weather-related synthetic workloads.

\chapter*{Dedication}
I dedicate my thesis work to my family, teachers and specially friends at \acrfull{curw}. A special feeling of gratitude to my loving parents, Nandawathi Dissanayake and H.M.K. Karunarathne whose words of encouragement and push for tenacity ring in my ears. My wife Jayani Kumarasinghe have never left my side and are very special.

I also dedicate this thesis to my many friends at \acrshort{curw} who have supported and be with me during this period of time. Also special thanks to Dr. Dilum Bandara and Dr. Srikantha Herath for giving me this wonderful opportunity to explore this new domain.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I wish to thank my evaluation panel members who were more than generous with their expertise and precious time. A special thanks to Dr. Dilum Bandara, my research supervisor for his countless hours of reflecting, reading, encouraging, and most of all patience throughout the entire process. Thank you Dr. Dilika Peris, and Dr. Indika Perera for agreeing to serve on my evaluation panel and Dr. Srikantha Herath for agreeing to serve as my external supervisor.

I would like to acknowledge and thank Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, for allowing me to conduct my research and providing any assistance requested. Special thanks go to both academic and non-academic staff of the department for their continued support. I also gratitude to the University of Moratuwa for the financial support as the research was supported in part by the Senate Research Grant of the University of Moratuwa under award number SRC/LT/2017/01,  and \acrfull{curw} for providing the grant and financial support during the research period with providing required resources and learning opportunities.

Finally, I would like to thank the teachers, evaluating panel and colleagues that assisted me with this project. Their excitement and willingness to provide feedback made the completion of this research an enjoyable experience.
