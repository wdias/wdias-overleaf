%\chapter*{\hspace{1cm} Abstract}

To enhance the accuracy of weather predictions, it is necessary to provide reliable and detailed weather data as inputs to Numerical Weather Models (NWM). These NWMs utilize weather data collected via diverse sources such as automated weather stations, radars, air balloons, and satellite images. Prior to feeding such diverse data (collected from different sources that belongs to different stakeholders) into respective NWMs, it is necessary to integrate data into a common format. Moreover, the data integration systemâ€™s response time need to be relatively low to accommodate critical situations like hurricanes, storms, and floods which require rapid and frequent execution of NWMs.

Providing public to access weather data is also useful to enable many third-party applications and research. For example, logistic companies can use those data with their own model to plan and schedule their deliveries. Agricultural insurance companies can warn the farmers in advance, as well as calculate premiums based on anticipated weather patterns.

While Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) and Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) are some of well-known Weather Data Integration and Assimilation (WDIA) systems, they are proprietary. Further Delft-FEWS is free to use, it is not open source. Hence, users of WDIA are forced to pay heavy licenses and are unable to extend the solutions to cater to their country-specific requirements. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a WDIA system for Sri Lanka, as well as make it open source, so that others could user and contribute to the solution.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I wish to thank my evaluation panel members who were more than generous with their expertise and precious time. A special thanks to Dr. Dilum Bandara, my research supervisor for his countless hours of reflecting, reading, encouraging, and most of all patience throughout the entire process. Thank you Dr. Dilika Peris, and Dr. Indika Perera for agreeing to serve on my evaluation panel and Dr. Srikantha Herath for agreeing to serve as my external supervisor.

I would like to acknowledge and thank Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, for allowing me to conduct my research and providing any assistance requested. Special thanks goes to both academic and non-academic staff of the department for their continued support. I also gratitude to the University of Moratuwa for the financial support as the research was supported in part by the Senate Research Grant of the University of Moratuwa under award number SRC/LT/2017/01.

Finally, I would like to thank the teachers, evaluators and colleagues that assisted me with this project. Their excitement and willingness to provide feedback made the completion of this research an enjoyable experience.

\section{Introduction}
This is a section.
\label{se:method introduction}
Here is an equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:staright line}
    y = mx + c,
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $c$ are constants. Sometimes we use the form $ax + by + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. Equation \ref{eq:staright line} represents a straight line.
