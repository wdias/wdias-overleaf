\section{Outline}
The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. Literature review is presented in Chapter \ref{ch:literature}, and discuss about the existing Weather Data Integration Systems such as \acrshort{lead}, \acrshort{fews}, \acrshort{madis}, and \acrshort{dias}. Solution approach with the proposed system architectures and adaptation with problem occurred are presented in Chapter \ref{ch:method}. It provides details about how the \acrshort{wdias} is design by following a microservice architecture and the date preprocessing capabilities of the system. Performance analysis is presented in Chapter \ref{ch:results}. Here we discuss experiment setup of the \acrshort{wdias} and analyze the observations with respect to performance metrics. Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:summary}, we conclude and summarize the work and further discussed about the research limitations and future work.
