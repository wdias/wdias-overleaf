\section{Problem Statement}
Handling spatio-temporal weather data is challenging. Need an extendable system to support weather models by efficiently storing and retrieving data. Therefore, in this context the problem can be state as;

\emph{necessaty of a Data Integration System which is scalable, highly available and capable of }
\emph{interact with different data formats including spatio-temporal bulk stream data, }
\emph{store efficiently while optimizing the disk space, }
\emph{support geographical and time-base queries, }
\emph{third parties can access the data with easy integration, and }
\emph{able to easy modify and use based on the requirements.}

\section{Objectives}
We address above problem statement by achieving the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop an open platform to integrate weather data from different sources in different formats
    \item To design and develop a schema to store multidimensional weather timeseries data while optimizing access time, availability, and storage
    \item To optimize schema to support data queries based on geography and time
    \item To develop an API to share data
    \item To use open source tools and provide the source publicly with appropriate liecense.
\end{itemize}
